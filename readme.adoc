# Case data science
## How to submit:

1. Upload your solution to (private) Github Repository or BitBucket or Gitlab if you work for OGD.
2. Invite software@ogd.nl to it so we can assess you work.

## Assignment
Use the Titanic dataset (in the repository) to train a model that predicts if a person will survive the Titanic disaster. Make the model available through an API.

* The repository should include everything required (including instructions) to be run (for example a Python requirements file).
* Apply analysis and preproccesing to the data.
* Use the training set to train your model and use the test set to determine the performance.
* Select an algorithm to train a model and assess its performance.
* Make the model available through an API.

### Tips
* Showcase your strengths! Whether it's data analysis, algorithm selection or creating a feature complete API.
